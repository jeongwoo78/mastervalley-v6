  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh',
    description: `Van Gogh is a defining figure of Post-Impressionism.
He began painting at 27 and produced 900 oil paintings in just ten years, yet only one sold during his lifetime.
Masterpieces like The Starry Night, Sunflowers, and Café Terrace at Night were all born in poverty and mental anguish.

He died at 37, but his art profoundly influenced Expressionism and Fauvism.
"I put my heart and soul into my work." — A painter who forged immortal beauty from suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt',
    description: `Klimt was the leading Art Nouveau painter of fin-de-siècle Vienna.
Born the son of a goldsmith, he applied real gold leaf to canvas, creating an opulent decorative world inspired by Byzantine mosaics.
He left behind golden masterpieces where sensuality and divinity coexist, including The Kiss, Judith, and The Tree of Life.

He founded the Vienna Secession, challenging the conservative art establishment.
"To every age its art, to every art its freedom." — A painter who captured fin-de-siècle beauty in gold.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch',
    description: `Munch is the defining Expressionist painter from Norway.
He lost his mother at five and his sister at fourteen, and the memory of these losses dominated his canvases for life.
His works, including The Scream, Madonna, and The Dance of Life, form "The Frieze of Life" — a cycle of love, death, and anxiety.

"I paint not what I see, but what I saw," he declared, exploring the deepest human emotions.
"Illness, madness, and death were the dark angels that watched over my cradle." — A painter who transformed inner darkness into art.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse',
    description: `Matisse is the leading Fauvist painter of France.
At 21, he began painting with a box of colors his mother gave him while bedridden, later recalling it felt like "discovering paradise."
The 1905 cry of "Wild beasts!" became the birth of Fauvism, and he left behind color-revolutionary masterpieces like The Dance, The Green Stripe, and The Red Room.

He conveyed emotion through pure color alone, pushing the decorative potential of painting to its limit.
"The purpose of color is not to describe form but to express emotion." — A painter who sang joy through color.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall',
    description: `Chagall was a painter of love and dreams.
Born in a Russian Jewish village, he moved to Paris and never put down his brush through two World Wars and exile.
His love for his wife Bella was a lifelong source of his art, leaving behind masterpieces like The Birthday, La Mariée, and I and the Village — canvases where bouquets and lovers float in midair.

He worked until 97, enchanting the world with the Paris Opéra ceiling and stained glass windows.
"In our life there is a single color, as on an artist's palette, which provides the meaning of life and art — the color of love." — A poet who erased the boundary between dream and reality.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso',
    description: `Picasso co-founded Cubism and changed the direction of modern art.
In his 91-year life, he left approximately 50,000 works. Legend has it that at 13, his art teacher father saw his talent and broke his own brushes.
He opened Cubism with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, denounced war with Guernica, and reached the pinnacle of deconstruction with Portrait of Dora Maar.

Through Blue Period, Rose Period, Cubism, and Surrealism, he constantly reinvented himself.
"Good artists copy, great artists steal." — A painter who broke all rules and created new ones.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo',
    description: `Frida Kahlo is Mexico's most original painter and a feminist icon.
She contracted polio at 6 and at 18 suffered a bus accident that shattered her spine and pelvis, enduring over 30 surgeries throughout her life.
She began painting while bedridden, looking at a mirror on the ceiling — and much of her work, including Me and My Parrots, The Broken Column, and Self-Portrait with Monkeys, are self-portraits.

Her art, with its honest portrayal of pain, love, and identity, continues to resonate deeply today.
"Feet, what do I need them for if I have wings to fly?" — A painter who transformed pain into art.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein',
    description: `Lichtenstein was a Pop Art master who broke the boundaries of fine art with comic book panels.
When his son pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic and asked, "Can you draw as well as this, Dad?", he actually began transferring comics to canvas.
With In the Car, M-Maybe, and Forget It!, he shook the art world by blowing up comic panels onto massive canvases.

With Ben-Day dots and bold outlines, he overturned the hierarchy between popular culture and high art.
"I don't draw comics, I paint pictures about comics." — A painter who erased the line between pop culture and fine art.`

  // ── Van Gogh ──
  'vangogh-starrynight': {
    description: `The swirling impasto brushstrokes of 〈The Starry Night〉 have been applied.
The intense contrast of cobalt blue and chrome yellow unleashes the energy of the night.

〈The Starry Night〉 was Van Gogh's reimagined vision of the landscape beyond his asylum window at Saint-Rémy.
Rather than painting the actual night sky, he projected his inner turmoil onto the stars.`
  },
  'vangogh-cafe': {
    description: `The complementary color nightscape technique of 〈Café Terrace at Night〉—without using black—has been applied.
Yellow gaslights and deep blue night sky express darkness through color contrast alone.

〈Café Terrace at Night〉 is the first outdoor night scene Van Gogh painted under starlight at Arles' Place du Forum.
The empty chairs on the terrace and passing figures hold both the stillness and warmth of the night.`
  },
  'vangogh-sunflowers': {
    description: `The subtle tonal variations of a single chrome yellow in 〈Sunflowers〉 have been applied.
Thickly layered paint captures the texture of the petals as they are.

〈Sunflowers〉 is a series Van Gogh painted to decorate the Yellow House in Arles for Gauguin's arrival.
Full blooms, wilted flowers, and seeds together reveal the cycle of life.`
  },
  'vangogh-selfportrait': {
    description: `The swirling background and thick impasto brushstrokes of 〈Self-Portrait〉 have been applied.
Cool tones of blue and green convey both solitude and resolve.

〈Self-Portrait〉 was painted when Van Gogh, too poor to afford models, used himself as subject.
The eyes gazing directly forward and tightly closed lips show unwavering will amid suffering.`
  },
  'vangogh-wheatfield': {
    description: `The dynamic curved brushstrokes and complementary color contrasts of 〈Wheat Field with Cypresses〉 have been applied.
Wind-blown wheat and flame-like cypresses convey nature's vital energy.

〈Wheat Field with Cypresses〉 is a landscape Van Gogh repeatedly painted near the asylum at Saint-Rémy.
The golden horizon of the wheat field and the vertical cypress connect earth and sky.`
  },

  // ── Klimt ──
  'klimt-kiss': {
    description: `The gold leaf background and geometric decorative patterns of 〈The Kiss〉 have been applied.
Rectangles on the man's robe contrast with curves and circles on the woman's, creating opposition and harmony.

〈The Kiss〉 is Klimt's masterpiece from his "Golden Phase," inspired by Byzantine mosaics.
The lovers' embrace wrapped in gold holds both the ecstasy of love and the anxiety of its passing.`
  },
  'klimt-treeoflife': {
    description: `The spiral curves and golden decorative patterns of 〈The Tree of Life〉 have been applied.
Triangles, circles, and spirals repeat, creating a rhythmic flow of life's energy.

〈The Tree of Life〉 was created as a dining room mural for the Stoclet Palace in Brussels.
The endlessly branching spiral limbs are a metaphor for birth, death, and the cycle of life.`
  },
  'klimt-judith': {
    description: `The gold leaf decoration and jewel-like sensual colors of 〈Judith〉 have been applied.
Transparent veils and gold necklaces create tension between the sacred and the sensual.

〈Judith〉 is Klimt's reinterpretation of the biblical heroine as a sensual woman.
Half-closed eyes and a provocative smile completely overturn the piety of traditional religious painting.`
  },

  // ── Munch ──
  'munch-scream': {
    description: `The undulating curves and distorted forms of 〈The Scream〉 have been applied.
A blood-red sky and rippling background contrast with the straight railing, creating extreme anxiety.

〈The Scream〉 captures the terror Munch felt when the sky turned blood-red during a walk.
The open-mouthed figure's cry is expressed not as sound but as a tremor passing through all existence.`
  },
  'munch-madonna': {
    description: `The red halo and undulating sensual curves of 〈Madonna〉 have been applied.
At the boundary between open and closed eyes, life and death merge into one.

〈Madonna〉 is Munch's reinterpretation of the Virgin Mary as a moment where sensuality and death intersect.
Closed eyes, parted lips, and a red halo reveal human desire rather than holiness.`
  },
  'munch-danceoflife': {
    description: `The symbolic contrast of light and dark colors in 〈The Dance of Life〉 has been applied.
With the central woman in a red dress as axis, innocence and despair are placed on either side.

〈The Dance of Life〉 is Munch's autobiographical work compressing memories of love and heartbreak into one canvas.
Light and dark colors alternate on a single canvas, capturing both the beginning and end of love.`
  },

  // ── Matisse ──
  'matisse-greenstripe': {
    description: `The bold color plane division that bisects the face in 〈The Green Stripe〉 has been applied.
Pink, yellow, and green coexist on the skin, completely ignoring natural color.

〈The Green Stripe〉 is a portrait Matisse painted of his wife Amélie, drawing cries of "Wild beasts!" at the 1905 Salon.
A single green stripe down the center of the face divides light and shadow through color alone.`
  },
  'matisse-purplecoat': {
    description: `The intense color planes and decorative flat composition of 〈Woman in a Purple Coat〉 have been applied.
The boundary between figure and background dissolves, with color itself creating space.

〈Woman in a Purple Coat〉 is a work where Matisse conveyed emotion through simplified forms and pure color.
The vast color plane of the purple coat dominates the canvas, merging with the background patterns as one.`
  },
  'matisse-redroom': {
    description: `The flat color plane composition that defies perspective in 〈The Red Room〉 has been applied.
The red wall and red table merge into one as arabesque patterns blanket the entire space.

〈The Red Room〉 was originally painted in blue, but Matisse repainted it red just before completion.
Even the view through the window appears as flat decoration, erasing the boundary between inside and out.`
  },
  'matisse-derain': {
    description: `The rough brushstrokes and unnatural skin colors of 〈Portrait of André Derain〉 have been applied.
Green shadows and orange skin, with bold primary colors, render the subject in a wild, Fauvist manner.

〈Portrait of André Derain〉 is a portrait of friendship Matisse painted of his fellow artist André Derain.
The two painters exchanged portraits of each other at the same time, sharing their Fauvist experiments together.`
  },

  'chagall-lamariee': {
    description: `The dreamlike contrast of red bouquets and blue night sky in 〈La Mariée〉 has been applied.
Animals and figures blend like apparitions, unfolding a festive fantasy.

〈La Mariée〉 captures the rooftops and church spires of Chagall's hometown Vitebsk as a landscape of memory.
The bride holding a red bouquet, overlaid with the village scene, holds both nostalgia and joy.`
  },
  'chagall-village': {
    description: `The multiple perspectives and transparently overlapping images of 〈I and the Village〉 have been applied.
People, animals, and village scenery intermingle dreamlike, defying scale and proportion.

〈I and the Village〉 was painted in Paris as Chagall longed for his hometown of Vitebsk.
Reality and memory merge on a single canvas, capturing an endless yearning for home.`
  },

  // ── Picasso ──
  'picasso-doramaar': {
    description: `The simultaneous front and side view of 〈Portrait of Dora Maar〉 has been applied.
Intense primary color planes divide the face geometrically, creating Cubist tension.

〈Portrait of Dora Maar〉 was painted by Picasso of his lover and fellow photographer Dora Maar.
The seated woman's front and side coexist in one face, revealing the complexity within.`
  },

  // ── Frida Kahlo ──
  'frida-parrots': {
    description: `The intense frontal gaze and Mexican folk colors of 〈Me and My Parrots〉 have been applied.
Vivid reds, greens, and blues fill the canvas alongside tropical foliage.

〈Me and My Parrots〉 is a self-portrait in which Frida is surrounded by four parrots.
Parrots are messengers of love in Mexican folklore, and faithful companions in Frida's solitude.`
  },
  'frida-monkeys': {
    description: `The frontal gaze and lush tropical background of 〈Self-Portrait with Monkeys〉 have been applied.
Amid dark green leaves, her intense eyes and connected eyebrows reveal her identity.

〈Self-Portrait with Monkeys〉 is a self-portrait Frida painted with her pet monkeys.
In Mexican mythology monkeys symbolize desire, but for Frida they were surrogates for the children she could never have.`
  },

  // ── Lichtenstein ──
  'lichtenstein-inthecar': {
    description: `The Ben-Day dots and thick black outlines of 〈In the Car〉 have been applied.
Only pure primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—fill the canvas like a comic book panel.

〈In the Car〉 was created by enlarging a panel from the comic Girls' Romances onto canvas.
Lichtenstein deliberately removed the speech bubble from the original, leaving only the power of the image instead of narrative.`
  },
  'lichtenstein-mmaybe': {
    description: `The Ben-Day dots and comic-book narrative of speech bubbles in 〈M-Maybe〉 have been applied.
Primary colors fill flatly within thick outlines, recreating the texture of a printed page.

〈M-Maybe〉 was a work Lichtenstein kept in his personal collection, which sold for $30,000—five times the going rate.
It is now displayed as a centerpiece of the Pop Art collection at Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany.`
  },
  'lichtenstein-forgetit': {
    description: `The Ben-Day dots and intense primary color contrasts of 〈Forget It!〉 have been applied.
Thick black outlines fix the form like a comic panel, compressing emotion dramatically.

〈Forget It!〉 is an early masterwork created just after Lichtenstein's first solo show in 1962.
That same year, Life magazine ran the headline: "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?"—about him.`
  },
  'lichtenstein-ohhhalright': {
    description: `The Ben-Day dots and flat color plane composition of 〈Ohhh...Alright...〉 have been applied.
Red, blue, and yellow separate cleanly within black outlines, as crisp as a printed page.

〈Ohhh...Alright...〉 is a 1964 work borrowed from issue #88 of Secret Hearts.
It sold for $42.6 million at Christie's in 2010, overturning the value of what he once called "used canvas."`
  },
  'lichtenstein-stilllife': {
    description: `The Ben-Day dots and thick outlines creating flat expression in 〈Still Life〉 have been applied.
Primary color planes simplify objects in a comic-like manner, recreating the texture of print.

〈Still Life〉 is part of a 1970s series in which Lichtenstein reinterpreted a traditional genre as homage to Picasso.
"There's no mood in my still lifes—it's just lemons and grapefruits," he said.`
  },

  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh Style',
    description: `Thick impasto technique and swirling brushstrokes have been applied.
The intense contrast of yellow and blue reveals inner emotions.

He left over 40 self-portraits, confronting his inner self most honestly through them.
The eyes gazing directly forward show unwavering will even amid suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt Style',
    description: `Real gold leaf and geometric patterns inspired by Byzantine mosaics have been applied.
Rectangles on men's clothing contrast with curves and circles on women's, expressing both opposition and harmony.

Spiral curves and ornate decoration wrap the figure in a mystical golden world.
Within this decoration, sensuality and divinity coexist.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch Style',
    description: `Swirling curves, distorted forms, and intense colors have been applied.
Blood-red skies and wavering landscapes visualize inner emotions.

He wrote in his diary that while walking by the Oslo fjord, he "heard an enormous scream pass through nature."
Before his paintings, the colors themselves become vibrations of emotion.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse Style',
    description: `Simplified forms and bold primary colors have been applied.
Rather than anatomical accuracy, focus is on the energy of movement, with color directly conveying emotion.

Just as The Red Room erased the boundary between table and wall, he chose harmony of color planes over perspective.
Before his canvas, colors sing out.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall Style',
    description: `A dreamlike atmosphere of pink, cobalt blue, and jewel-like colors has been applied.
Bouquets, lovers, and hometown scenes blend together like memories, lifting the weight of reality.

He composed his canvases with the logic of emotion rather than perspective or anatomy.
In his paintings, time and space halt before love, and the world fills with dreamlike light.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso Style',
    description: `Cubist techniques that deconstruct subjects into geometric planes and show front and side simultaneously have been applied.
Like Portrait of Dora Maar, multiple viewpoints coexist in a single face.

In Guernica, using only black and white, he conveyed the terror of war immediately. This destructive deconstruction was itself creation.
Five centuries of perspective rules shattered on his canvas.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo Style',
    description: `Traditional Mexican colors, tropical foliage, and communion with animals have been applied.
In Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, thorns symbolize pain and the dead hummingbird represents lost love.

Unable to have children, she treated her parrots and monkeys as family.
In her self-portraits, animals are not mere backgrounds but companions offering comfort amid suffering.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein Style',
    description: `Pop art techniques using Ben-Day dots from printed comics, thick black outlines, and primary colors have been applied.
Like the glamorous couple In the Car, every image becomes a comic book panel.

Like the dramatic expressions and speech bubbles of comic heroines, everyday moments transform into dramatic scenes.
Emotion exploding within mechanical dots and lines—that is Lichtenstein's paradox.`
