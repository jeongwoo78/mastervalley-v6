// ========== Loading Education (Biography) ==========
export const mastersLoadingEducation = {
  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh',
    description: `Van Gogh is a defining figure of Post-Impressionism. He began painting at 27 and produced 900 oil paintings in just ten years, yet only one sold during his lifetime. Even while confined to a mental asylum, he completed masterpieces including The Starry Night and Café Terrace at Night.

He died at 37, but his art profoundly influenced Expressionism and Fauvism. "I put my heart and soul into my work." — A painter who forged immortal beauty from suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt',
    description: `Klimt painted the golden dreams of fin-de-siècle Vienna. Real gold leaf adorned his canvases, and decorative patterns inspired by Byzantine mosaics and Japanese art merged with sensual figures. His founding of the Vienna Secession declared art's liberation from academic tradition.

He captured both sacred and profane beauty within shimmering gold. "Art is a line around your thoughts." — A painter who blended sensuality and divinity.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch',
    description: `Munch was a painter who lost his mother at 5, his sister at 14, and bore witness to death throughout his life. This accumulated grief transformed into swirling forms and blood-red skies on his canvases. The Scream wasn't depicting external screams, but visualizing the existential anxiety resonating within.

His private trauma became universal emotion. "I paint not what I see, but what I saw." — A painter who turned inner pain into art.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse',
    description: `Matisse began painting during recovery from appendicitis at 20. In 1905, his bold colors at the Salon d'Automne earned him the title "Fauve" (wild beast). He saw color not as description of reality, but as direct expression of emotion.

Even in his final years, confined to a wheelchair, he created vibrant paper cut-outs. "I want my art to be like a comfortable armchair." — A painter who sang joy through color until his last breath.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall',
    description: `Chagall was born in a Jewish village in Belarus and met his lifelong love Bella at 22. She became the protagonist of his art—floating lovers, flowers, and dreamlike villages all circled around her. For 29 years until her death, and 40 years after, he continued painting his love for her.

He lived 98 years and created over 10,000 works. "Only love interests me, and I am only in contact with things that revolve around love." — A painter of 100 years of love.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso',
    description: `Picasso co-founded Cubism and changed the direction of modern art. In his 91-year life, he left approximately 50,000 works. Legend has it that when he was 13, his art teacher father saw his talent and broke his own brushes. Through Blue Period, Rose Period, Cubism, and Surrealism, he constantly reinvented himself.

In 1937, Guernica denounced the horrors of war: "Painting is not made to decorate apartments. It is a weapon against the enemy." — A painter who broke all rules and created new ones.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo',
    description: `Frida Kahlo is Mexico's most original painter and a feminist icon. She contracted polio at 6 and at 18 suffered a bus accident that shattered her spine and pelvis, enduring over 30 surgeries throughout her life. She began painting while bedridden, looking at a mirror on the ceiling—55 of her 200 works are self-portraits.

Her passionate love with muralist Diego Rivera was also a central theme. "Feet, what do I need them for if I have wings to fly?" — A painter who transformed pain into art.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein',
    description: `Lichtenstein was a Pop Art master who broke the boundaries of fine art with comic book panels. When his son pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic and asked, "Can you draw as well as this, Dad?", he actually began transferring comics to canvas. His first comic painting Look Mickey (1961) sparked debate: "Is this art?"

He elevated the comic form itself into fine art, overturning the hierarchy between popular culture and high art. "I don't draw comics, I paint pictures about comics." — A painter who erased the line between pop culture and fine art.`

// ========== Result Education (Style/Technique) ==========
export const mastersResultEducation = {
  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh Style',
    description: `Thick impasto technique and swirling brushstrokes have been applied. The intense contrast of yellow and blue reveals inner emotions.

He left over 40 self-portraits, confronting his inner self most honestly through them. The eyes gazing directly forward show unwavering will even amid suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt Style',
    description: `Real gold leaf and geometric patterns inspired by Byzantine mosaics have been applied. Rectangles on men's clothing contrast with curves and circles on women's, expressing both opposition and harmony.

Spiral curves and ornate decoration wrap the figure in a mystical golden world. Within this decoration, sensuality and divinity coexist.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch Style',
    description: `Swirling curves, distorted forms, and intense colors have been applied. Blood-red skies and wavering landscapes visualize inner emotions.

Munch wrote in his diary that while walking by the Oslo fjord, he "heard an enormous scream pass through nature." Before his paintings, the colors themselves become vibrations of emotion.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse Style',
    description: `Simplified forms and bold primary colors have been applied. Rather than anatomical accuracy, focus is on the energy of movement, with color itself becoming a language that directly conveys emotion.

Just as The Red Room erased the boundary between table and wall, Matisse chose harmony of color planes over perspective. Before his canvas, colors sing out.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall Style',
    description: `A dreamlike atmosphere of pink, cobalt blue, and jewel-like colors has been applied. Bouquets, lovers, and hometown scenes blend together like memories, lifting the weight of reality.

Chagall composed his canvases with the logic of emotion rather than perspective or anatomy. In his paintings, time and space halt before love, and the world fills with dreamlike light.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso Style',
    description: `Cubist techniques that deconstruct subjects into geometric planes and show front and side simultaneously have been applied. Like Portrait of Dora Maar, multiple viewpoints coexist in a single face.

In Guernica, using only black and white, he conveyed the terror of war as immediately as a newspaper. This destructive deconstruction was itself creation. Five centuries of perspective rules shattered on his canvas.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo Style',
    description: `Traditional Mexican colors, tropical foliage, and communion with animals have been applied. In Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, thorns symbolize pain and the dead hummingbird represents lost love.

Unable to have children, Frida treated her parrots and monkeys as family. In her self-portraits, animals are not mere backgrounds but companions offering comfort amid suffering.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein Style',
    description: `Pop art techniques using Ben-Day dots from printed comics, thick black outlines, and only primary colors of red, blue, and yellow have been applied. Like the glamorous couple In the Car, every image becomes a comic book panel.

Like the dramatic expressions and speech bubbles of comic heroines, everyday moments transform into dramatic scenes. Emotion exploding within mechanical dots and lines—that is Lichtenstein's paradox.`
