// ========== Loading Education (Biography) ==========
export const mastersLoadingEducation = {
  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh',
    description: `Van Gogh is a defining figure of Post-Impressionism.
He began painting at 27 and produced 900 oil paintings in just ten years, yet only one sold during his lifetime.
Masterpieces like The Starry Night, Sunflowers, and Café Terrace at Night were all born in poverty and mental anguish.

He died at 37, but his art profoundly influenced Expressionism and Fauvism.
"I put my heart and soul into my work." — A painter who forged immortal beauty from suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt',
    description: `Klimt was the leading Art Nouveau painter of fin-de-siècle Vienna.
Born the son of a goldsmith, he applied real gold leaf to canvas, creating an opulent decorative world inspired by Byzantine mosaics.
He left behind golden masterpieces where sensuality and divinity coexist, including The Kiss, Judith, and The Tree of Life.

He founded the Vienna Secession, challenging the conservative art establishment.
"To every age its art, to every art its freedom." — A painter who captured fin-de-siècle beauty in gold.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch',
    description: `Munch is the defining Expressionist painter from Norway.
He lost his mother at five and his sister at fourteen, and the memory of these losses dominated his canvases for life.
His works, including The Scream, Madonna, and The Dance of Life, form "The Frieze of Life" — a cycle of love, death, and anxiety.

"I paint not what I see, but what I saw," he declared, exploring the deepest human emotions.
"Illness, madness, and death were the dark angels that watched over my cradle." — A painter who transformed inner darkness into art.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse',
    description: `Matisse is the leading Fauvist painter of France.
At 21, he began painting with a box of colors his mother gave him while bedridden, later recalling it felt like "discovering paradise."
The 1905 cry of "Wild beasts!" became the birth of Fauvism, and he left behind color-revolutionary masterpieces like The Dance, The Green Stripe, and The Red Room.

He conveyed emotion through pure color alone, pushing the decorative potential of painting to its limit.
"The purpose of color is not to describe form but to express emotion." — A painter who sang joy through color.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall',
    description: `Chagall was a painter of love and dreams.
Born in a Russian Jewish village, he moved to Paris and never put down his brush through two World Wars and exile.
His love for his wife Bella was a lifelong source of his art, leaving behind masterpieces like The Birthday, La Mariée, and I and the Village — canvases where bouquets and lovers float in midair.

He worked until 97, enchanting the world with the Paris Opéra ceiling and stained glass windows.
"In our life there is a single color, as on an artist's palette, which provides the meaning of life and art — the color of love." — A poet who erased the boundary between dream and reality.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso',
    description: `Picasso co-founded Cubism and changed the direction of modern art.
In his 91-year life, he left approximately 50,000 works. Legend has it that at 13, his art teacher father saw his talent and broke his own brushes.
He opened Cubism with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, denounced war with Guernica, and reached the pinnacle of deconstruction with Portrait of Dora Maar.

Through Blue Period, Rose Period, Cubism, and Surrealism, he constantly reinvented himself.
"Good artists copy, great artists steal." — A painter who broke all rules and created new ones.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo',
    description: `Frida Kahlo is Mexico's most original painter and a feminist icon.
She contracted polio at 6 and at 18 suffered a bus accident that shattered her spine and pelvis, enduring over 30 surgeries throughout her life.
She began painting while bedridden, looking at a mirror on the ceiling — and much of her work, including Me and My Parrots, The Broken Column, and Self-Portrait with Monkeys, are self-portraits.

Her art, with its honest portrayal of pain, love, and identity, continues to resonate deeply today.
"Feet, what do I need them for if I have wings to fly?" — A painter who transformed pain into art.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein',
    description: `Lichtenstein was a Pop Art master who broke the boundaries of fine art with comic book panels.
When his son pointed to a Mickey Mouse comic and asked, "Can you draw as well as this, Dad?", he actually began transferring comics to canvas.
With In the Car, M-Maybe, and Forget It!, he shook the art world by blowing up comic panels onto massive canvases.

With Ben-Day dots and bold outlines, he overturned the hierarchy between popular culture and high art.
"I don't draw comics, I paint pictures about comics." — A painter who erased the line between pop culture and fine art.`

// ========== Result Education (Style/Technique) ==========
export const mastersResultEducation = {
  'vangogh': {
    name: 'Van Gogh Style',
    description: `Thick impasto technique and swirling brushstrokes have been applied.
The intense contrast of yellow and blue reveals inner emotions.

He left over 40 self-portraits, confronting his inner self most honestly through them.
The eyes gazing directly forward show unwavering will even amid suffering.`
  },
  'klimt': {
    name: 'Klimt Style',
    description: `Real gold leaf and geometric patterns inspired by Byzantine mosaics have been applied.
Rectangles on men's clothing contrast with curves and circles on women's, expressing both opposition and harmony.

Spiral curves and ornate decoration wrap the figure in a mystical golden world.
Within this decoration, sensuality and divinity coexist.`
  },
  'munch': {
    name: 'Munch Style',
    description: `Swirling curves, distorted forms, and intense colors have been applied.
Blood-red skies and wavering landscapes visualize inner emotions.

He wrote in his diary that while walking by the Oslo fjord, he "heard an enormous scream pass through nature."
Before his paintings, the colors themselves become vibrations of emotion.`
  },
  'matisse': {
    name: 'Matisse Style',
    description: `Simplified forms and bold primary colors have been applied.
Rather than anatomical accuracy, focus is on the energy of movement, with color directly conveying emotion.

Just as The Red Room erased the boundary between table and wall, he chose harmony of color planes over perspective.
Before his canvas, colors sing out.`
  },
  'chagall': {
    name: 'Chagall Style',
    description: `A dreamlike atmosphere of pink, cobalt blue, and jewel-like colors has been applied.
Bouquets, lovers, and hometown scenes blend together like memories, lifting the weight of reality.

He composed his canvases with the logic of emotion rather than perspective or anatomy.
In his paintings, time and space halt before love, and the world fills with dreamlike light.`
  },
  'picasso': {
    name: 'Picasso Style',
    description: `Cubist techniques that deconstruct subjects into geometric planes and show front and side simultaneously have been applied.
Like Portrait of Dora Maar, multiple viewpoints coexist in a single face.

In Guernica, using only black and white, he conveyed the terror of war immediately. This destructive deconstruction was itself creation.
Five centuries of perspective rules shattered on his canvas.`
  },
  'frida': {
    name: 'Frida Kahlo Style',
    description: `Traditional Mexican colors, tropical foliage, and communion with animals have been applied.
In Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird, thorns symbolize pain and the dead hummingbird represents lost love.

Unable to have children, she treated her parrots and monkeys as family.
In her self-portraits, animals are not mere backgrounds but companions offering comfort amid suffering.`
  },
  'lichtenstein': {
    name: 'Lichtenstein Style',
    description: `Pop art techniques using Ben-Day dots from printed comics, thick black outlines, and primary colors have been applied.
Like the glamorous couple In the Car, every image becomes a comic book panel.

Like the dramatic expressions and speech bubbles of comic heroines, everyday moments transform into dramatic scenes.
Emotion exploding within mechanical dots and lines—that is Lichtenstein's paradox.`
