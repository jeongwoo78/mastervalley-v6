// ==================== Primary Education (Loading Screen) ====================

export const oneclickMastersPrimary = {
  content: `Seven masters—before they were geniuses,
they were wanderers searching for their own language.

Van Gogh left 900 works in 10 years,
and his stars still swirl today.

Klimt hid love and death beneath gold,
Munch screamed his loss throughout his life.

Matisse kept the joy of color even through war,
Chagall flew through the sky with his beloved.

Frida faced herself with a broken body,
Lichtenstein questioned the world with a single comic panel.

They asked, they broke, they rebuilt.
Seven worlds—now it's your turn to respond.`

// ==================== Secondary Education (Result Screen) ====================

export const oneclickMastersSecondary = {

  'vangogh': {
    content: `Van Gogh was an artist who expressed emotion directly through color.
He used the impasto technique, layering thick paint, with brushstrokes swirling intensely.

Bold complementary contrasts of yellow and blue dominate his canvases.
Every brushstroke carries his passion and solitude.`
  },

  'klimt': {
    content: `Klimt was an artist who painted the golden dreams of fin-de-siècle Vienna.
He applied real gold leaf to canvas, with geometric patterns inspired by Byzantine mosaics.

Spiral curves, circles, and triangles create decorative rhythms across the entire surface.
Beneath that gold, sensuality and divinity intertwine as one.`
  },

  'munch': {
    content: `Munch painted not what he saw, but what he felt.
He revealed human psychology through swirling curves and distorted forms.

Blood-red skies and sickly colors visualize existential anxiety and fear.
From his brush, inner screams burst forth.`
  },

  'matisse': {
    content: `Matisse was an artist who liberated color as the language of emotion.
He rejected realistic colors, boldly placing greens, purples, and oranges on faces.

Complex forms are daringly simplified into curves and flat planes.
In his paintings, color sings on its own.`
  },

  'chagall': {
    content: `Chagall was an artist who captured love and dreams on canvas.
He painted worlds of memory and fantasy with dreamlike colors and surreal compositions.

Pink, soft purple, and cobalt blue wrap around memories of his hometown Vitebsk.
In his paintings, reality and dreams blend without boundaries.`
  },

  'picasso': {
    content: `Picasso was the greatest revolutionary of the 20th century, founder of Cubism.
He deconstructed objects into geometric planes and reassembled multiple viewpoints on a single canvas.

His signature is the multi-perspective structure where front and side views exist simultaneously.
He dismantled 500 years of perspective's established order.`
  },

  'frida': {
    content: `Frida Kahlo was an artist who transformed pain into art.
She confronted herself with an intense gaze and symbolic elements.

Red, yellow, and green Mexican folk colors dominate her canvases.
In her paintings, pain and existence become one.`
  },

  'lichtenstein': {
    content: `Lichtenstein was a Pop Art master who elevated comics to fine art.
He enlarged Ben-Day dots from print media and fixed forms with bold black outlines.

Only pure primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—fill his canvases.
He broke down the boundary between popular culture and fine art.`
